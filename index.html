            <p><big><big>Director <b>Sam Raimi</b>, who has made three blockbuster Spider-Man films in the 2000s has
                        been in the news in recent times for the possibility of a fourth Marvel superhero
                        film.</big></big></p>
            <!-- New paragraph -->
            <p><big><big>However, this hasn't developed beyond fan theories and rumours. Raimi too in a recent interview
                        said he doesn't feel Marvel and Columbia will come back to him as the current Spider-Man movies
                        are doing well.</big></big></p>
            <!-- para 2 -->
            <p><big><big>But giving some thought to even the remotest possibility of Spider-Man 4, Sam Raimi said he
                        would understand Tobey Maguire's character arc and the obstacles in Peter Parker's personal
                        growth. He further stated the choice of villain would be determined by how the obstacles are
                        represented by the story.
                        When asked if he has specific ideas, Raimi said he should work on ideas only after holding
                        discussions with Tobey and writers.
                        <br><br>
                        Meanwhile, actor Thomas Haden Church, who played Sandman in <b>Spider-Man 3</b>, said he would
                        be excited to star in the fourth part. Addressing the rumours, Church added that if
                        <b>Spider-Man 4</b> goes on floors and he is asked to join, he will go the very next
                        day.</big></big></p>
